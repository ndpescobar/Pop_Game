# Pop_Game by Nicolas Plata-Escobar. 2015.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pop Game is a little project of mine just to keep my skills hot. It is not great work, but it is a project 
for me to learn and experiment with Processing. 

I chose to make a game because I love video games, and I am studying to become a programmer.

Pop_Game is all about reflex. This game will test your speed of moving the mouse across the screen to 
"hit", or click, objects that will go "POP!"

The game is still in progress as of 7/30/2015. I am planning to have a "playable" version of the game by 
the end of 2015. This game may not be the same as I described above, but I will create a game around that 
description. As I wrote in the first paragraph, this is a project for me to learn, experiment, and keep my 
skills hot.

*Anyone may use this code without permission because it may not be the greatest code you'll see.
